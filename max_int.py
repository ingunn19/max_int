# Program finds the maximum positive integer input by user

# get continuous input from the user until a negative value is entered
# as the user inputs values save it as a variable
# if the next value input is larger than the one currently saved as the max overwrite with the higher value
# when a negative value is input stop asking for input print the currently saved highest input and end the program
